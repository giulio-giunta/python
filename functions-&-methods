# Difference between functions and methods:
# A method is just a type of function! When we have a function that is attached 
# to a specific object, i.e. a list, it becomes a method of a list

# Built-in functions:
print()
len() -> to get the number of character in a string or the number of elements in a list
round() -> to round a number
choice() -> to choose an element at random
list() -> to create a list
int() -> to convert into an integer
bool() -> to convert into a boolean 
dict() -> to create a dictionary
tuple() -> to create tuples
set() -> to create sets


# String methods
.upper() -> to convert to upper case 
.lower() -> to convert to lower case
.capitalize() -> to make upper case only the first character in a list
.replace() -> to replace a character in a string with another. This method requires 2 items: the old and the new one.

# List methods

# to add elements
.append() -> to add one element only at the end of a list
my_list.append('new_element')

.extend() -> to add multiple elements at the end of a list
my_list.extend(['element_1', 2, 'element_2])

.insert() -> to add an element in a list after a specific index position in the list
my_list.insert(index,'element)

.copy() -> to copy a list

# to delete elements
.clear() -> to delete all elements from a list
my_list.clear()

.pop() -> to remove an elemnet from a list by specifying the index; if no element it's specified, the last element is deleted
my_list.pop(): will delete the last element; my_list.pop(0): will delete the first element

.remove() -> to remove the first occurrence of an element whose value is in the list
my_list.remove(element_value)

# a mix of methods for lists
.index() -> to find the index of an element (included in the parenthesis) - can specify start and end
my_list.index(element_value)

.count() -> to return the number of times an element appears in a list - need to include the element in the parenthesis
my_list.count(element_value)

.reverse() -> to reverse the order of the list in place
my_list.reverse()

.sort() -> to sort the name of the list in place (in ascending order)
my_list.sort()

.join() -> it's a method used for strings, so in a list it joins for example the items in a list in a long strings
fratelli = ['Lorenzo', "Bruno"]
fratelli = " e ".join(fratelli)
print(f'{fratelli} sono i miei fratelli')

# dictionary methods
.values() -> to retrieve values from a dictionary
.keys() -> to retrieve keys from a dictionary
.items() -> to retrieve keys and values from a dictionary
.clear() -> to clear a dictionary from all keys and values
.copy() -> to copy a dictionary
{}.fromkeys() or dict.fromkeys() -> to populate an empty dictionary with keys from an iterable (list, string,[] etc) and a defined value.
.get() -> to the value of a key if it exists in the dictionary; it works similarly as "value in dict()", but it return 'None' if no key exists.
.pop() -> to remove an item from a dictionary; needs the key of the item to delete inside the brackets
.popitem -> to delete an item at random; does not need to specify any keys
.update() -> to add the items of a dictionary into an othe dictionary or overwrite the existing items with new values but doesn't delete anything if an empty dictionary is passed

# Tuple methods
.count() -> to return the number of times an element appears in a tuple
.index() -> to return the index at which an element is located in a tuple. If multiple items, only the index of the first element is returned.

#  Set methods
.add() -> to add elements into a set
.remove() -> to remove elements from a set
.discard() -> to remove an element without getting errors if the element to remove doesn't exist
.copy() -> to make a copy of the set
.clear() -> to remove the entire content of the set
setMath: to obtain the 'union' or 'intersection' of two or more sets
